BatMods-lite is a Python package that includes:

1) A library and API for pre-built battery models
2) Kinetic/transport properties for common battery materials

## Installing
We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) to create and manage your Python virtual environments. The following directions assume you are using Anaconda. 

After installing Anaconda and downloading or cloning the BatMods-lite repo files onto your local machine, open Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (MacOS/Linux) and run the following to: (1) create an environment named "batmods," (2) activate your new environment, (3) install scikits.odes, and (4) install batmods-lite. 

1) ``conda create -n batmods python=3.10``
2) ``conda activate batmods``
3) ``conda install scikits.odes``
4) ``pip install ./batmods-lite`` or ``pip install -e ./batmods-lite``

**Notes:**
* Feel free to replace "batmods" in steps (1) and (2) with your preferred environment name.

* Step (3) uses ``conda install`` rather than ``pip install`` to simplify setup. Installing scikits.odes via ``pip`` requires a pre-installed SUNDIALS and C++/Fortran compilers. If you'd like to try to skip using ``conda``, please refer to the [scikits.odes documenation](https://scikits-odes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

* The ``-e`` flag in step (4) installs BatMods-lite in "editable" mode. You should use this if you plan to make changes to the package.

* The path ``./batmods-lite`` in step (4) assumes your terminal's working directory is the parent directory for the "batmods-lite" folder. If this is not true, please ``cd`` into the correct directory, or change the path to point to the correct folder.

## Get Started
You are now ready to start running models. Run the following from your favorite terminal/IDE to see helpful documentation, examples, and more:

```python
import bmlite as bm

bm.docs()
```

**Notes:**
* If you are new to Python, check out [Spyder IDE](https://www.spyder-ide.org/). Spyder is a powerful interactive development environment. BatMods-lite is programmed almost entirely using the Spyder IDE. 

* If you choose to use Spyder, you can install it using ``conda install spyder``. Afterward, you can find the application on your system, or simply type ``spyder`` in Anaconda Prompt or Terminal to open an instance.

## Formatting
With minor exceptions, BatMods-lite code follows the [PEP8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008). Specifically, adding extra spaces around parentheses, and under- or over-indenting multi-line expressions is allowed when it improves readability or avoids the 80-character line limit. 

Please be aware that it is the authors' preference to not adopt the more opinionated [black formatting style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html). Make sure that you do not autoformat any files in this style if you choose to contribute.
