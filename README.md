BatMods-lite is a Python package that includes:

1) Library of pre-built battery models
2) Kinetic/transport properties for common battery materials

## Installing
We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) to create and manage your Python virtual environments. The following directions assume you are using Anaconda. 

After installing Anaconda and downloading the BatMods-lite repo files, open Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (MacOS) and run the following to: (1) create an environment named "batmods," (2) activate your new environment, (3) install scikits-odes, and (4) install batmods-lite. 

1) ``conda create -n batmods python=3.10``
2) ``conda activate batmods``
3) ``conda install scikits.odes``
4) ``pip install ./batmods-lite`` or ``pip install -e ./batmods-lite``

**Notes:**
* Step (3) installs scikits.odes separately through ``conda install`` rather than ``pip install`` to simplify setup. Installing scikits.odes via ``pip`` complicates this step by requiring a pre-installed SUNDIALS and C++/Fortran compilers. 

* The ``-e`` flag in step (4) installs BatMods-lite in "editable" mode. You should use this if you plan to make changes to the package.

## Get Started
You are now ready to start running models. Run the following from your favorite terminal/IDE to see helpful documentation, examples, and more:

```python
import bmlite as bm

bm.docs()
```

## Formatting [![PEP8](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-pep8-orange.svg)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
BatMods-lite code follows the PEP8 style guide. It is the autors' preference to not adopt the more opinionated `black` formatting style. Please keep this in mind if you plan to contribute.
