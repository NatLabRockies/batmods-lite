.. py:class:: CPSolution(sim: object, exp: dict)




   Constant power solution for SPM simuations.

   Base: :class:`~bmlite.SPM.solutions.BaseSolution`

   When initialized, a copy of the SPM simulation object and experimental
   details for the solution instance are stored, all other instance
   attributes are set to ``None``. These are filled later with a "fill"
   method (e.g., ``ida_fill()`` or ``dict_fill()``).

   :param sim: The SPM Simulation instance used to produce the solution.
   :type sim: SPM Simulation object
   :param exp: Experiment dictionary. Specific key/value pairs are dependent on
               the experiment that was run.
   :type exp: dict

   .. py:property:: classname
      :type: str

      Class name. Overwrites ``BaseSolution``.

      :returns: **classname** (*str*) -- Name of current class.

   .. py:method:: verify(plotflag: bool = False, rtol: float = 0.005, atol: float = 0.001) -> bool

      Verifies the solution is mathematically consistent.

      Specifically, for a constant power experiment, this method checks
      that the calculated power was within tolerance of the boundary
      condition. In addition, this method checks the anodic and cathodic
      Faradaic currents against the current at each time step and the
      solid-phase lithium conservation.

      If the verificaion returns ``False``, you can see which checks failed
      using ``plotflag``. Any subplots shaded grey failed their test.
      Failures generally suggest that the solver's relative and/or absolute
      tolerance should be adjusted, and/or that the discretization should be
      modified to adjust the mesh.

      :param plotflag: A flag to see plots showing the verification calculations. The
                       default is ``False``.
      :type plotflag: bool, optional
      :param rtol: Relative tolerance for comparisons. The default is 5e-3.
      :type rtol: float, optional
      :param atol: Absolute tolerance for comparisons. The default is 1e-3.
      :type atol: float, optional

      :returns: **checks** (*bool*) -- ``True`` is all checks are satisfied, ``False`` otherwise.
