    "To run any model in BATMODS-lite, you will need to construct a `Simulation` and `Experiment`. All `Simulation` classes are constructed using a `.yaml` file that contains a description of the parameters. The easiest way to find out how to build a `.yaml` input for the model you wish to run is to get a template from `bmlite.templates`. When calling the `templates` function, just pass the name of the model subpackage (case insensitive) to get a list of available templates."

When an integer is given, `np.linspace(0, t_max, Nt)` is used to construct the times at which the solution will be saved by using `tspan = (t_max: float, Nt: int)`. Alternatively, if you provide a float, the value is interpreted as a constant $\\delta t$. So, in the second example below, we plan to save the solution every 10 seconds. If the $\\delta t$ does not evenly fit into `t_max`, then the last time step may differ from the one specified. Lastly, for complete control over your timespan, you can pass an array. The only requirements of the array are that the first element is zero, it has a length of at least two, and all values are monotonically increasing."

In some experimental steps, it may be more important to have a tight tolerance, whereas a loose tolerance may be sufficient for other steps. To see a full list of solver options, check out the `bm.IDASolver` class. In cases where you want to modify the solver options to not use a default value across all steps in an experiment, you should pass the solver options during the original initialization. Alternatively, you can specify solver options at a step by step level. If you specify a global experiment option and also provide that same option for any given step, then the value specified in the step will take precedence. For example, the experiments below ensure the maximum integration step `max_step=10` for all steps, sets the absolute tolerance of the second step as `atol=1e-9`, and overwrites of the `max_step` option in the third step to be `1` instead of `10`."

    "## Limits\n",
    "Multi-step experiments in the lab are typically programmed by using limits or events. For example, discharge a battery until 3V is reached. This capability is also available in the `Experiments` class by using the `limits` keyword. Each step can have one or more limits to give a variety of control over defining your experiment. However, there are a few important things to understand about how these limits are used within the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to ensure that your limit is what triggers your experiment to go from one step to another, you will have to specify a maximum time for your step that is beyond when you expect the limit to be reached. For example, given a 2C discharge, I might set my `t_max` to be for one hour or 3600 seconds to make sure that I hit a 3V limit. Another important point is in regard to the `tspan` construction mentioned above. When using limits, it is best practice to use the $\\delta t$ construction approach. Lastly, when time is used as a limiting criteria, the limit tracks the total experiment time rather than the relative step time. This is because you can easily control a step time by adjusting its `t_max` value, but it is not particularly straight forward to figure out how to limit steps beyond the first by the total time without the use of limits. \n",
    "\n",
    "One last important point about using limits is that they are not directional. The limit detection scheme works by tracking whether the specified value has been \"crossed\" or not. For example, a limit of 3.5V can be triggered on either charge or discharge as long as the voltage was lower or higher, respectively, than 3.5V before starting that step. Consequently, it is very important to have an idea regarding the state of your battery for each step when providing limits. If you were charging the battery and wanted to stop at 3.5V, but the battery started its charge already at 3.6V then your limit would never be triggered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are a few examples to demonstrate how to input limits. Note that not all steps in an experiment need to have limits, and that is it possible to have more than one limit by listing them in pairs of \"name\" and \"value\". For a full list of allowed limits, see the full `bm.Experiment` documentation."

This is valuable in cases where you want to investigate complex charging protocols with voltage ramps, or if you want to run a sinusoid to extract phase and magnitude information that provides insight into the impedance. \n",
    "\n",
    "To run a dynamic load, simply create a function like `f(t: float) -> float` where `t` is the relative step time in seconds and the output of the function is the demand value. This generic interface makes it simply to construct demands based on interpolation or any other user-defined function. These functions can even be inline `lambda` functions if they are short enough.

    "From the output above you can see that the first step was successful, how long it took to solve, and some additional details. Generally, running step-by-step is valuable when the solver is having difficulties converging based on the demand for a single step or more. By being able to see which steps are failing and looking into their solutions, you can better calibrate solver settings that make sense for your case study. \n",

    "There are a couple important thing to understands about how BATMODS-lite `Simulation` classes run these experiments. Each `Simulation` instance has an internal state associated with it. This state gets updated and saved each time an experimental step is run using the `run_step` method. Therefore, you should only ever run steps in order and should also always start with the zero indexed step. Furthermore, you must be very careful if you are running more than one `Experiment` with a given `Simulation`. If we were to take the same experiment above and run it again using the `run` method instead of `run_step`, we may not be starting from the exact same initial state that the battery had at time `t=0`. If this is the desired behavior then there is nothing else you need to do between running experiments. However, if you do need to reset the `Simulation`, you will need to use the `pre` method, as shown below."

    "The `pre` method simply resets the internal state back to the same condition it had when first initialized. Now, let's re-run this same experiment using the `run` method. Again, the `run` method will perform the loop through all steps for you and will return a single solution that is stitched together rather than one solution per step. The default behavior of the `run` method will also automatically run the `pre` method at the end of all steps. You can disable this using the optional `reset_state=False` argument. A case where you would not want to reset the stat would be is you are using different charge and discharge experiments and you want to make sure that each experiment starts from the state of the previous experiment. Alternatively, consider a case where you only want to know the performance of a battery across a range of different discharge rates, but you do not need to be concerned with charging data. In such a scenario, you could initialize the `Simulation` in a fully charged state and run each discharge solution with the automatic resets that occur when `reset_state=True`, which would allow you to skip having to program charges into your experiment. Overally, this would likely take half as much time to simulate compared to running full charge and discharge cycles. "

    "There are a variety of things you can learn from these models and their solutions. You will want to read through and understand more about the `Solution` classes to find exactly what you are looking for. The `vars` list in the presentations above helps a bit with this. These are the keywords in the solution's `vars` dictionary. This dictionary stores the sliced solution variables for each domain and some other helpful information like the time, current, and voltage values. To understand more about how the domain state variables are sliced and stored, refer to the `bm.SPM.domains` module. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are mostly only analyzing time, current, voltage, and/or power, then you likely won't need to dig into the `domains` module. Instead, you might be more interested in using some built-in plotting functions to quickly access your solutions. For this purpose, all `Solution` classes have a `simple_plot` method that takes any two of the non-domain `vars` keys and plots them against each other. For example, below we use the `combined_soln` from above to plot the full timeseries voltage data."
