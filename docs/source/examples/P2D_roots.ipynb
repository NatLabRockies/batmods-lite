    "# Root Functions\n",
    "In the previous examples, you'll notice that all of the simulations ran out to the full ``t_max`` value. In a lot of cases, you may want your simulation to exit prior to reaching ``t_max`` based on some other criteria. For example, keeping the battery voltage above 3 V on discharge and below 4.2 V on charge. Passing an optional root function argument to the solver allows this behavior. Root functions for the P2D model are available in the ``P2D.roots`` module. You can see examples of using both voltage and current limits below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Voltage limits\n",
    "In the code below, we run the same constant current experiment from an earlier tutorial. However, in this example, we changed ``t_max`` to ``3600`` seconds. We also changed ``Nt`` to 3601 to have a finer resolution in time. Since the voltage drops quickly near 3 V, this will allow us to get more data near the end of discharge. Setting ``t_max`` to a full hour on a 2C discharge is done because we don't know exactly when the cell will reach 3 V, but we know it will be less than an hour. \n",
    "\n",
    "To set the root function, create an instance of the ``VLimits`` class with a lower limit of 3 V and an upper limit of ``np.nan``. The root function instance gets passed to the ``run_CC()`` method as an optional keyword argument. Note that we also need to tell the solver how many events are tracked in the root function. The number of roots is available under the ``size`` property of the root instance. Here, ``rootfn.size = 2`` because ``VLimits`` tracks two roots (one for the lower voltage limit and one for the upper voltage limit)."
