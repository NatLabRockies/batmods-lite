    "# Making Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to make the necessary input files to build a P2D simulation that describes your specific battery and experiment. The battery input files are organized as ``.yaml`` files with sections for ``battery``, ``electrolyte``, ``anode``, ``separator``, and ``cathode`` parameters. The easiest way to get started is to use the ``default_P2D.yaml`` file template. This can be accessed using the ``bmlite.P2D.templates()`` method, as shown below."

    "In the output above, you can see the full list of parameters that must be specied in a P2D ``.yaml`` file when constructing a ``bm.P2D.Simulation`` class. Indents in the ``.yaml`` file are important. You can see that all the indented values under ``battery`` relate to battery-level parameters, whereas values indented under ``cathode`` refer to cathode-specific parameters. To make your own ``.yaml`` file, it is recommended to copy these contents into your own file and edit the values as needed. Afterward, you can initialize a simulation with your parameters by using the ``bm.P2D.Simulation`` class. For example, if your new ``.yaml`` file is named ``'newfile.yaml'`` and is available in your current working directory, you can construct your simulation with\n",

Also, the input should be the absolute or relative path to your ``.yaml`` file, so if you save the file to a location outside your current working directory, you will have to modify the code above to point to the actual file location. You can also always construct a simulation with the ``'default_P2D.yaml'`` parameters by leaving the input blank. You will be presented with a warning in your console to when you construct a default simulation.\n",

    "You can see that the ``'constant_current'`` template output is a standard python dictionary and does not have the same indented organization as the ``'defualt_P2D.yaml'`` template. That is because the experiment templates are not for the ``bm.P2D.Simulation`` initialization. Instead, they are the inputs for specific experiments that can be run after the simulation has been constructed. All of the experiments are accessed from methods in the ``sim`` object that start with \"run.\" Each experiment is covered in more detail in its own tutorial. However, in short, you can copy/paste/edit this ``exp`` dictionary as necessary and pass it to the appropriate ``run_CC()`` method to run a constant current experiment. You can access more details (i.e., units and key descriptions) about any of the ``exp`` templates by calling ``help()`` on the respective \"run\" method. For example, to get more information for a constant current experiment, use ``help(sim.run_CC)``."
